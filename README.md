# RMG_Random-Map-Generator
"RMG : Random Map Generator" is a python project that allows you to generate random map in a PNG format !

How does RMG work ?

- genererImage.py is a python implementation of the "Diamond-Square" algorithm. After using it, it's gonna generate a black and white random image.
- traiterImage.py generates different types of maps from a black and white random image. The brighter a pixel, the deeper the corresponding point on the map. The darker a pixel, the higher the corresponding point on the map.

You can see some results of the "Diamond-Square" algorithm in the basesGenerees folder.
You can also see some map results in the cartesGenerees folder. They were generated from the base0.png file.
