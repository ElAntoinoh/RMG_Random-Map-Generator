# RMG_Random-Map-Generator
"RMG : Random Map Generator" is a python project that allows you to generate random map in a PNG format !

How does RMG work ?

- genererImage.py is a python implementation of the "Diamond-Square" algorithm.
- traiterImage.py read a String parameter to choose which type of map you whant to generate. The default case will generate a normal map.

You can see some results of the "Diamond-Square" algorithm in the basesGenerees folder.
You can also see some map results in the cartesGenerees folder.
